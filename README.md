# Object-Relational-Mapping-with-the-SQLAlchemy-ORM
## Description:
The project presents the development of a management system for a veterinary clinic, initially focused on the administration of owner data, specifically for individuals. This system is the result of an applied study aimed at creating a practical solution for performing CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) on the "owner" entity. The main objective of the project is to provide a tool that facilitates the management of important information, such as the names, addresses, and contact numbers of animal owners who visit the clinic. The methodology used includes the implementation of an SQLite database, integrated into the system through object-relational mapping (ORM) using the SQLAlchemy library. As a result, a functional system was developed that efficiently manages owner data, allowing for the registration of new records, CPF-based queries, information updates, and record deletions. Although CRUD is currently limited to the "owner" entity, there is a plan to expand to include animals, veterinarians, and species. It is concluded that the system provides a robust and practical foundation with the potential to enhance data management in the veterinary clinic.
